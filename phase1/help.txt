=====================================================================================================
These instructions will give you an insight on how to get the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes.

Software required: IntelliJ IDE

Running the program:
The project consists of 14 different classes in total and 3 .fxml files. In total there are 2 scenes, the first
scene where the user can select an image file, and the second scene where the user can perform actions to that
image file. Execution starts in the main class TagIT. At execution, the TagIT program begins by opening a window
to the first scene, that prompts the user to select a directory by clicking the <<Select Directory>> button. Once
clicked, a window to the user's computer File System Viewer will appear and the user can select a directory in which
they want to pull up image files.

Features:

1. View all the image files in a directory:
    - Clicking the <<Select Directory>> button and choosing a directory, will result in a list of all
      the file paths of image files in that directory. That will be shown in the ListView object along the
      left hand side of the first scene.

2. Preview images:
    - you can preview an image by clicking on its file path in the ListView in the first scene.

3. View list of existing Tags associated with an image:
    - Click the <<Select Image>> button on the first scene, it will take you to the second scene.
      There will be a ListView object on the right hand side of the screen that shows the list of existing tags for
      the image.

4. View Tags associated with the current image's file name:
    - in the second scene, along the bottom, there is a ListView that shows all the tags the image has in its filename

5. Add tag to image file name:
    - Textfield in the second scene above the <<Add Tag>> button lets user type in a new tag and clicking the
      <<Add Tag>> button adds it to the image file name(ie. the List View along the bottom of the scene). The tag
      must start with '@' else it will not add to the image file name. When a new tag is added to the file name,
      it is also added to the ListView containing the existing image tags for this image file. You can also add a tag
      by selecting from the ListView of existing tags for the file and then clicking the <<Add Tag>> button.

6. Remove tag:
    - select a tag in the bottom ListView in the second scene, and click the <<Remove Tag>> button to delete the Tag.

7. View all the names an image has had:
   -

8. Move image:
   - you can move the current image to another directory by clicking the <<Change Image Location>> button. A window
     will open to choose a directory. Once you click <<Open>> the image will have moved to the chosen directory.

9. Open image in enclosing folder:
    - Clicking the <<Open in Enclosing Folder>> button in the second scene, opens a window to the user's File System
      Viewer to show the directory the current image is in


Details:
When the program is closed, all Tag and ImageFile changes and information is serialized. When the program is run
again, the serialized data is deserialized and stored to work off of.
A HistoryManager class is used to log the changes the user makes when the program is run. (uses Logger)
