# CSC207 - Group Course Project 

For the final project, our class was given instructions to build an application that allowed users to search for images
on their computer and "tag" them by editing the filename to include "@tag". This allows users to then search for files
using their OS's search feature by the tag. Additional unique features for our group include a few image filters as well as
a unique CSS layout. 

## Getting Started

To start with testing or developing the project, clone the repo URL into a directory, and you can simply 
edit code in an editor if you wish. You can also open up the repo in an IDE such at Netbeans or IntelliJ and work from here.
Check the BugsToFix.txt or the ToDo.txt in the Notes folder for current issues / tasks. 

Currently in development only, cannot be deployed at the moment. Hope to change this soon!

### Prerequisites

To run the application itself, you will need Java 8, and it is currently not OS specific, though any future iterations will 
be designed to ensure program can run on Mac, PC, and Linux distributions as well. 

You wil need the Java JDK8 to develop the application. 

For ease, you wish to download JavaFX's SceneBuilder to edit the fxml files in a user-friendly, drag & drop interface. Java 
currently has an older version and Gluon has taken over hosting the newer open sourced versions of the application. Either will
work.

You may wish to have an IDE for ease of coding / debugging purposes.

Sources for programs : 

JDK8: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Java IDE IntelliJ Community Edition: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac

SceneBuilder (Linked version hosted on Gluon): http://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/

### Installing

Step 1 - Install JDK8 from Oracle site. 

Step 2 (Optional) - Install SceneBuilder from linked URL. 

Step 3 (Optional) - Install Java IDE from linked URL. 

Step 4 - Run through a chosen IDE, or through Terminal. 

(Through a Chosen IDE) 

- Navigate to modelControllerFiles package, and click run on Main.java to have program up and running. 

(Through Terminal)

- Navigate to repo on Terminal. 
- Enter: javac src/modelControllerFiles/Main.java
- Enter: java src/modelControllerFiles/Main

You can simply click on the starting button at this point, and work to create a directory and run through the steps.
