- Plus Button on Add Tag - MOSTLY DONE (Now you can't click the exact center spot
                                        but guys, who tf cares)

- Open Enclosing Folder, linux CDF

- Select Image on directory / null click - DONE

- Help menu, TagITHelp.txt, About -> Hook up paypal account (y) Buy us coffee!!

- Text Runover (WRAPPING LISTVIEWS)

- When you move an image to a new location, and then you try to tag it after its been moved, it disappears from the new
location. If you then go back, and re enter the image, the program loses track of this images tags(appears to be making
a new imagefile for this image)

- When you open a directory that has an image with two same tags, both tags get added to All Tags
    |-> stupid bug, but I mean if we have time, might as well attempt a fix.

- Betty says Moving photos laterally
    |-> WTF does this even mean??? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

- Able add too multiple tags of the same to an ImageFile. By typing it out and then by selecting it from AllTags again,
  it adds a Tag twice. (It is in All Tags originally because it was read from the directory viewer prior to selecting an Image.)
